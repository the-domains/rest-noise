//WHO I AM//

Mike is a tenacious and excitable percussionist and sound artist currently residing in Jamaica Plain, MA, just outside of Boston. He has a long and hearty history with sound exploration. After growing up in Pickerington, OH, Mike moved to Lexington, KY to study with Professor James Campbell at the University of Kentucky. After receiving his Bachelors in Percussion Performance, he moved north to Boston to study with Nancy Zeltsman, Keith Aleo, and Sam Solomon at The Boston Conservatory. There, he received his Masters in Percussion Performance after performing his Masters Recital and Thesis Defense: "Kicking and Screaming: A Synthesis of Voice, Theater, and Percussion." Mike also passionately participated in the Free Improvisation Seminar led by Boston pianist Pierre Hurel of The Pierre Hurel Trio.

Since that time, Mike has been active in pursuing his vision as a collaborator and sound artist. He has worked with New England afro-funk ambassadors, The Macrotones, and recorded on their soon-to-be released album, _Ancient Outpost. _He was also part of Soundry, a 2014 Boston Conservatory Entrepreneurial Alumni Grant-winning chamber sextet who performed music not often heard in the Boston area. Since 2013, Mike has collaborated repeatedly with Maria Finkelmeier of [Kadence Arts][0], and he will be performing in the upcoming Kadence Arts-produced and Boston-premiere of John Luther Adams' _Inuksuit _in June 2016\.

Mike is a dynamic performer and focuses on works from composers of the 20th and 21st centuries. He endorses [Vic Firth][1], [Evans][2], [Gretsch Drums][3], Black Swamp Percussion, and [Cooperman Fifes and Drums][4].
